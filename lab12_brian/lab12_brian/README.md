This took way too long. Couldn't get all my views to work. We didn't get IEnum to work in class and couldn't figure it out on my own.
Struggled with most of it. I can at least use 3 of the 5 ways to pass data and one of them is using the Model so i'm not going to worry about the others. Also couldn't get my CSS document to work.
